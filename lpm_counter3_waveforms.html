<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file "lpm_counter3.v" </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of lpm_counter megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design "lpm_counter3.v". The design "lpm_counter3.v" is a 8 bit up counter. The counter has a synchronous clear input. </P>

<P><FONT size=3>The behavior of the cin input is identical to the behavior of the cnt_en input. The output port cout will be asserted at the completion of count sequence. The ports cin and cout are used to chain multiple counters together. </P>
